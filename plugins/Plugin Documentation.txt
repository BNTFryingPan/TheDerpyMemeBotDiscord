The Derpy Meme Bot discord uses the Discord.py API wrapper

Heres the basics of what you need to know:

If you know Python, you probably dont need to read this, but you probably should, to get a basic idea of how to make a plugin
using this API

First you want to make a new text document, then rename it to
<pluginName>.py
Your computer should ask you if your sure you want to change the file extension, as the file may become unstable
click OK or whatever your computer says

This file is your plugin file, and you want to add your code here.
Your first four lines of your plugin file should be:

Next, copy this into your plugin file:

import sys 
sys.path.append('..')
import discordBot as bot
import discord
    
botclient = None
__commands__ = [] # Add a list of any commands your bot uses here

async def chat(channel, message=None, tts=False): # used to send messages, channel is the id of the channel, message is what should be in the message, and tts is if it should be a TTS message
    if message == None:
        dp('Bot tried sending an empty message!')
        return None
    else:
        try:
            msg = await botclient.send_message(channel, message, tts=tts)
            return msg
        except discord.errors.Forbidden:
            p('The bot is not allowed to send messages to this channel')
            return None
            
async def on_message(message): # this funtion is where all your code for your plugin will go
    server = message.server
    ch = message.channel # shortcut for the channel, use this as the first variable when sending a chat message
    channel = message.channel
    author = message.author # shortcut for the author of the message
    
    
    arguments = message.content.split(' ') # splits the command at each space, so we can eaisly get each argument
    command = arguments[0].lower() # Lets you check the first argument of a message, as this will usually be the command
    
    if server == None: # These variables dont exist in the context of a DM
        isAdmin = True
        isOwner = True
    else:
        isAdmin = author.server_permissions.administrator # if the user is an admin in the server
        isOwner = author == message.server.owner # is the user is the owner of the discord server

    if command == '!command':
        pass
